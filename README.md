## What hasn't been done (but can be done if given more time):

1. Thousands separator
2. Shopping cart icon

## What can be improved:

1. Text truncate: currently it is a hard cut-off. I think it can be improved by using `overflow: hidden` so the text width adjusts dynamically depending on the width of the surrounding box.

2. Height of each product in mobile view is not consistent. It can be fixed.
