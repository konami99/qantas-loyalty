# Qantas Loyalty - ULTRA - Front-End Code Test

## Instructions

We would like you to work on this coding test for us to see how you would approach building a feature. We think you should spend about 4 hours on the code test, we consider it a starting point to extend and modify in our technical interview with you.

## User Story to Implement

As a user of Qantas Wine, I would like to see a carousel of a list of products

## More Information

Use the attached image of the wine carousel as a guide and feel free to use any technology that you are comfortable with.
It is not necessary to match the given design pixel-perfect, e.g. you can use a default font and red and green. Try to stick to the general layout though and don't deviate too much.

We are also providing you with a sample API response in form of a [JSON file](../assets/payload/data.json) that should be used to generate the results on this page.

We value writing well tested code at Qantas Loyalty and would like to see tests around any code you write.

You can assume this app to only be run in modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) supporting recent features.

## Included files

- [JSON payload: data.json](../assets/payload/data.json)
- [Mock of Qantas Wine carousel: mockup.jpg](../assets/images/mockup.jpg)
  ![mockup.jpg](../assets/images/mockup.jpg)
- List of images for the products
  - [aberlour.webp](../assets/images/aberlour.webp)
  - [houraisen.webp](../assets/images/houraisen.webp)
  - [prohibition_gin_500ml.webp](../assets/images/prohibition_gin_500ml.webp)
  - [royalSalute.webp](../assets/images/royalSalute.webp)

## Deliverables

- source code
- tests
- commit history
- instructions to run the app, tests, etc.
- a readme with comments about your approach and trade-offs you possibly made

## What are we looking for?

We'll be assessing your ability to write clean, well designed and well tested production-quality code.

We respect your time so please don't spend more than 4-5 hours working on this. We'd rather you submitted something partially complete after that time for us to discuss than spend days of your own time working on it.

## What comes next?

We'll send you feedback on your code. If the outcome isn't to the standard we require for the role we'll always aim to have you at least learn something from the process.

We may also want to discuss your code with you, to understand your approach and the tradeoffs you made.

Since a truly objective test of well-designed code is that it accepts changes in a reasonable manner, we often like to ask you to pair with someone from our team on an extension to the problem. For familiarity, we'll always try to do that on your machine, with your text editor.

Feel free to send through any questions you may have.

**Thanks for applying for a job at Qantas Loyalty and good luck! :-)**
